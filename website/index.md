# Network Science

**Course Description:** Networks are everywhere, you just have to look for them.  This course will discuss finding networks among the everyday, describing and representing datasets as networks, analyzing networks, real-world models, social network analysis, and time-varying graphs. 

**Availability:** It is important to me to be available to our students,
and to address their concerns. If you cannot meet with me during our
office hours, e-mail me and we will find the time to meet. That being
said, like everybody else I am quite busy, so it may take a day or more
to find a time to meet. And if you have any comments on the
course---what is working, what is not working, what can be done better,
etc.---I am very interested in hearing about them. There is an anonymous
feedback tool through Collab, or you can send me or one of the TAs an
e-mail. We tend to get bogged down by e-mail as the semester progresses,
so seeing us in person (right after lecture, during office hours, etc.)
is often a good way to get a more immediate response.

## Resources

### Textbook

Course material will cover topics from the following textbooks.  The first is available for free online.  The second is available in print as well as through the UVA library.
* Albert Barabasi, [Network Science](http://networksciencebook.com/)
* Mark Newman, [Networks (2nd Edition)](https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u7879307)


### Datasets

Here are some links to datasets for experimentation.  They may *not* be used for the course project.

* [UVA Dataverse](https://dataverse.lib.virginia.edu/)
* [Social Network and Archival Context](https://snaccooperative.org)
* [Archive.org](https://archive.org)
* [Network Science Book Datasets](http://networksciencebook.com/translations/en/resources/data.html)
* [ICON datasets](https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks)

## Grade Breakdown

* 40% Assignments
* 15% Exam 1
* 15% Exam 2 
* 30% Final Project (Paper + Presentation)
* 10% Extra Credit

### Project

The course will culminate in a final project in groups of 2-4 students.  Each group will be required to identify an interesting network dataset, represent that dataset as a network, then analyze it using the methods taught throughout the semester.  Groups will be required to write a 7-10 page final paper (ACM format) and present their work at the end of the semester.

## Course Schedule

We will attempt to keep to this schedule throughout the semester.  As we go through the semester,
I will add homework deadlines.
