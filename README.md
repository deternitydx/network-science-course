# Network Science Graduate Level Course

## Personal Notes

- Implement Barabasi's suggested intro homework (have students build a network of the course itself)
- Incorporate Barabasi's suggested final project (i.e., not just downloading a dataset, but gathering it yourself, such as scraping wikipedia or some other data)
    - Project proposals within the first few weeks to discuss the datasets chosen and methods to gather the data.
